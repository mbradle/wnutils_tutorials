You can run the notebooks on [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) by clicking on the Open in Colab badge.  You will need to sign in with your Google account.  Also, please note that the initial start up will take some time as the notebook will download the data needed for the tutorial.

Alternatively, you can run on your local computer.  To do so, once you have installed [the Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org), download one of the linked notebooks above (right-click or control-click).  To run the notebook from the command line, type, for example,

**jupyter notebook wnutils_read_data_tutorial.ipynb**

Be sure to remove any suffix that is not *.ipynb* on any notebook file you download.  For example, some browsers will by default add a *.txt* to the downloaded file so that it has suffix *.ipynb.txt*.  Remove the *.txt* before running.
